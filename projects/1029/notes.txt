Need diagrams to explain:

	The goal of fast display text in 3D

	Building your own stroke font

	Making optimal use of what the GPU does well

	Core problem to solve:

		draw a sequence of lines with constant thickness.

	Algorithm to draw one segment.

	Algorithm to draw multiple segments.	

	Combining all text into a single mesh (review).

	Varying parameters
		Inter-character spacing
		Inter-line spacing
		Width to height ratio

	Variants:
		making the text italic
		making the text bold

	Interesting questions to think about:

		What is the best way to specify italic, bold, color, etc.
		Can we do other things with the text?
		Can we use this to render other sorts of things?
		Can we generate other fonts procedurally?
			Eg: define letter shapes with splines.

	Intro to implicit surfaces

	Printiple in one dimension

	Blobby shapes

	Show in two dimensions

	Marching squares

	Principle in 3 dimensions

	Marching cubes -- Bill Lorenson

	My variant -- marching simplices
