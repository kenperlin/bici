This is the first version of bici -- a lightweight platform for enhanced video chat.
This first version was implemented by Ken Perlin in 2025.

In Spanish bici means "bicycle" -- a lightweight and efficient means of transport.
In Chineses bici ( 彼此 ) means "each other".

This first version works with the "share screen" option in video chat programs like Zoom.
Eventually bici will become stand-alone.

Usage:
1. In a console window, start a local web server from within the bici/ folder.
2. Launch http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.
3. Hit the 'h' key on your keyboard to see the help menu.
